# Introduction

This is a brief introduction to ReactJS where we will discuss its benefits and challenges as well as tackle an example to take us through some of core features of ReactJS in a way that won't make heads spin.



This is the first of a series of mini e-books written with the intention of sharing well organized tutorials that you can keep as a reference.



Each book will introduce or dive into a technology related topic as well as provide exercises for practice.



These books are meant to be growing entities rather than static content, i.e. feel free to get in touch and let me know your thoughts or perhaps other topics that you'd like to see covered.
