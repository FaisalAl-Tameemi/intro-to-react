# Next Steps

Learning ReactJS may be a little bit of an uphill climb in the beginning but the reality is that it's the more natural way of thinking about your web applications.

Everything is represented as a component. This is very similar to hour our real-life environment works, we can consider atoms to be the most reusable component in life :) -- Or perhaps we can look at the cells in our bodies, also reusable components, but applied at the biological level.

Set a target for yourself, try to build a mini application with ReactJS and research the parts which you aren't sure about.

__Always Be Learning!__
