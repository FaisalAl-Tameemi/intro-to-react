# Intro To ReactJS


## What Is ReactJS?

ReactJS is a Javascript library built, by Facebook, to solve the problem of building applications with interactive and reusable UI (User Interface) components whose data changes overtime.

Many companies now use ReactJS in production. Checkout the resources provided below for more on this.

One of the unique benefits that ReactJS brings is its ability to be rendered on both the browser and the server. This means that companies that need to build highly secure applications can build apps that are entirely rendered on the server side. 

_Note: There are other reasons for doing server side rendering but those are out of scope for this e-book and can be discussed seperately._

Another benefit that ReactJS has is that it doesn't render (repaint the browser view) all the time without first checking if anything has actually changed. This makes your application more efficient if used correctly. ReactJS does this with a concept called Virtual DOM which we'll be discussing a little later.
