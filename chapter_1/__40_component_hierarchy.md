In order to leverage the power of ReactJS and use it to build large web applications, you must learn to break down your applications into smaller pieces, each doing exactly what it needs to do and not more.

This process of dividing up the tasks of your entire application among reusable UI components can be a little challenging at first as the rewards are harder to really observe, however as your application gets larger and larger, having an organized breakdown of your app can be of immense benfit.
