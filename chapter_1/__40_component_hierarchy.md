# Component Hierarchy

In order to really leverage the power of ReactJS and use it to build reusable components, you must learn to break down your applications into smaller pieces, each doing exactly what it needs to do and not more.

This process of dividing up the tasks of your entire application among reusable UI components can be a little challenging at first as the rewards are harder to really observe, however as your application gets larger and larger, having an organized breakdown can be of immense benfit.

It is also important to note that this isn't the only way to build scalable web applications but it is certainly a pattern that is being adopted even by Javascript MVC frameworks such as Angular2.
