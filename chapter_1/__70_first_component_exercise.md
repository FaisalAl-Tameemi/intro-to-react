# Your First ReactJS Component

To see where the page is being rendered from, use your code editor to open the `/src/index.jsx` file. You will notice that we are importing a JSX file called App which contains the main component of our page.

```javascript
import App from './App.jsx';
```

We are also calling the `<App />` component and rendering it within the the `div` which has an ID `react-root`.

```javascript
ReactDOM.render(<App />, 
                document.getElementById('react-root'));
```
