# `.createClass` vs `Extends`

### TLDR;

There are 2 ways to create components in ReactJS. 

1. `.createClass` is a React method for creating a Class to represent a component. It takes an object as a parameter which contains all the component's methods.

2. `extends Component` - This way of creating components uses ES6 classes which inherit from the base React Component to do the same task mentioned above.

You are encouraged to read Todd Motto's article (linked in resources below) to understand the difference in much more detail.

We will be used the ES6 style way (i.e. with `extends Component`) in this document.
