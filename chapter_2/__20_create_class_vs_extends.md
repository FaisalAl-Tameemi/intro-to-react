# `.createClass` vs `Extends`

### TLDR;

There are 2 way to create components in ReactJS. 

1. `.createClass` - This way of creating components uses a built in React method to create the class and pass to it an object.

2. `extends Component` - This way of creating components uses ES6 classes which inherit from the base React Component

You are definetly encouraged to read Ted Motto's article (linked in resources below) to understand the difference in much more detail.

We will be used the ES6 style way (i.e. with `extends Component`) in this document.
